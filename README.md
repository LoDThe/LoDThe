## About me

Hi, I'm Igor!

In high school times I was interested in competitive programming.

Currently I'm getting a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia. I'm graduating in 2023.

Moreover, I work as a golang software engineer at Chatex â€” a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace. And I'm looking for a summer 20201 SWE internship.
