In high school times I was interested in competitive programming.

Currently I'm getting a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia. I'm graduating in 2023.

Moreover, I work as a Golang Software Engineer at Chatex &mdash; a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency marketplace. And I'm looking for a summer 2021 SWE internship.
